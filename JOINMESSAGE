## MIDNIGHT STAR - AN INTRODUCTION

Midnight Star is an arms dealing syndicate run by a mysterious woman known as The Sovereign, with the help of her board of Directors. Midnight Star is known as a community of professional arms dealers, ruthless terrorists, and iconic business owners. Here it is up to you to build a path in this group for your character, be what you want to be. We will give you the basics, and see what you do with them.

## LEGENDS OF THE REBELLION

Midnight Star is home to a multitude of Legends. These people have pulled off insane feats. They go by monikers, probably ones more synonymous than their real names. Stick with us, play your cards right, and carve your own spot as a legend.

## ARMS DEALERS FIRST

Midnight Star primarily focuses on providing a consistent and reliable broker for weapons and other munitions to the rebellion. Whether that be other factions, or solo rebels and little friend groups. After you receive your training you'll be placed as a Scav. What you do from there, whether it be an arms dealer yourself, or buy your way into Nightwatch with the blood on your hands. You keep what you earn, the group does not take cuts in anyway, so you make 100% of the profits from your sales.

## TERRORISM ISN'T SOMETHING WE'RE SHY TO, THOUGH...

If you decide to prove yourself bloodthirsty, where your primary desire is to wreak havoc, raid, and strike fear into the Combine, you may possibly qualify to join Nightwatch. Nightwatch is a team that specializes in coordinated acts of terrorism, as well as special and covert operations. It takes a lot to qualify, but once you're in, you're in. This isn't to say that your position as a Scavenger is free of causing havoc. Scavs will often hunt OTA for loot.

## That about sums up what our group is about...
If you're still interested, we'd love to have ya. We've got an alien empire to burn, and we'd like you to be there to help us.
